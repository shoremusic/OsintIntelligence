# OSINT Intelligence Platform

An advanced Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) platform that combines machine learning and multi-source API querying to transform raw data into actionable intelligence reports.

## Application Description

The OSINT Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive tool designed to automate and streamline the process of gathering, analyzing, and presenting open-source intelligence. It employs a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Python-based Flask Backend**: Provides a robust foundation for the web application, API handling, and database interactions.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI and OpenRouter models to analyze input data, select appropriate APIs, and generate intelligence reports.
- **Multi-API Connector System**: Dynamically selects and queries the most relevant APIs based on available data and investigation requirements.
- **Three-Tier API Categorization**: Organizes APIs by data type, entity type, and specific attributes for intelligent selection.
- **Workflow Engine**: Enables creation and execution of automated intelligence gathering workflows with varying complexity levels.
- **Visualization and Reporting Engine**: Presents intelligence findings in clear, actionable formats with visualizations.

The platform follows a specific intelligence gathering workflow:

1. User inputs minimal information (all fields optional)
2. AI processes and catalogs the input data
3. AI selects appropriate APIs based on available data 
4. AI prepares and sends API calls
5. APIs return formatted responses
6. AI parses responses and removes irrelevant data
7. AI provides summary and prepares aesthetic reports
